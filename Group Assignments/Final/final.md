## Research Questions
- How has traffic collisions change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?

- Has the rate of traffic collisions increased since COVID-19 began?

- Are these collisions occuring in the same areas or spreading to new areas?

- Has the severity of the collisions changed?

- How has the type of collisions changed?

### Background
The Coronavirus Disease, 2019 ("COVID-19" or "COVID") rapidly changed the daily lives of all. With the first Los Angeles case reported in January from an individual traveling through LAX, the virus quickly spread nationwide, prompting "Stay-At-Home" orders and health directives. As cases continue to skyrocket, we wanted to explore the impact that COVID-19 may have had on traffic collisions in the City of Los Angeles.

In March of 2020, the novel coronavirus spread throughout the country, resulting in widespread stay-at-home orders. As the stay-at-home order continued, people began searching for ways to move about in a socially distant manner, including active transportation modes, such as walking and biking. The creation of slow streets –residential streets that have been marked with temporary barricades and signage to reduce traffic flow– encouraged active transportation by designating safer areas that were car-free. With this mode shift occurring and combined with the stay-at-home orders encouraging people to work from home if possible, there was a decrease in daily commuters. However, with fewer cars on the road, data has shown that there has been an increase in reckless driving, such as speeding. Together, these transportation shifts create the possibility for greater traffic collisions between vehicles and pedestrians, and cyclists, leading to our research questions noted above.

Previous work has shown that traffic incidents occur in a small percentage of the overall road network, typically occurring in lower-income communities. However, since the start of the COVID-19 stay-at-home order, we are curious to see if this relationship between traffic accidents and locations has changed when compared to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is critical, especially with some slow streets becoming permanent, to ensure the safety and efficiency of pedestrians and cyclists. We hope to visualize the difference between collision severity, whether the collision involved a pedestrian or cyclist, and an average number of collisions per day against demographics in the city.

For this analysis we are focusing on the City of Los Angeles, separating by neighborhoods as defined by L.A. Times. Using these spatial scopes will allow us to factor in demographics to determine if there are any relationships. The maps will use demographics as a base layer, using a color gradient to demonstrate demographical differences, and pinpoint locations of collisions using a three-dimensional component.

### Data Sources

City of L.A. Traffic Collisions 2010 to Present

This dataset allows us to track traffic collisions in the City of Los Angeles. We were able to use dates from 1/1/2019-3/18/2020 as Pre-COVID-19 data, and 3/19/2020 onwards as COVID-19 data. (The Stay-at-Home order was executed on March 19th, 2020.)

City of L.A. Neighborhoods

This dataset allows us to overlay the L.A. neighborhoods with the collision data.

We performed the following analyses for both pre-COVID and during COVID time periods:

- Assess where the highest rate of daily traffic collisions was occurring (i.e. what LA neighborhood)

- Track the types of collisions occurring (including: Vehicle vs Pedestrian, Vehicle vs Vehicle, Vehicle vs Bike, & Bike vs Other)

- Track the severities of injury (including: Severe Injury, Visible Injury, Complaint of Injury, Fatal Injury, & Non-Injury)
